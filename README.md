# Tank Game

Tank Game is a simplistic rendition of the popular game "Wii Play Tanks", implemented in C++ using the Box2D physics engine for physics simulation, SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics rendering.

## Project Status

This project is currently in its early development stage. It features basic physics simulation and rendering setup.

## Goals

The following are the goals for the future development of this project:

1. **Gameplay Features**: Add functionality for shooting mechanics, enemy AI, and player interactions.

2. **Level Editor**: Develop a user-friendly level editor tool that allows players to create and customize their own levels.

3. **Enhance Graphics and Sound**: Improve the visual and audio aspects of the game.
